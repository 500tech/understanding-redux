# Understanding Redux

*Note:* The React example is written in JSX, so we need a babel-transpiler
that will convert it to plain JS. It is included in the file, but you need
to run it with any HTTP server.

The easiest way would be to use `http-server`:


```
$ npm install -g http-server

$ http-server .
```
